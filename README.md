## Project Title
Tokens for Providing Portfolio Feedback

## Project Description
This project incentivizes users to provide feedback on portfolios by rewarding them with blockchain-based tokens. Each user who submits feedback receives a specified amount of `FeedbackToken` (FBT), which can be transferred, stored, or utilized within the ecosystem. The system is implemented as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
